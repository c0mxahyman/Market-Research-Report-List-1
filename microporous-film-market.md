<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microporous Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional Stretching</li><li>Biaxial Stretching</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The microporous film market is categorized into two main types based on stretching techniques: unidirectional stretching and biaxial stretching. Unidirectional stretching involves stretching the film primarily in one direction, resulting in enhanced strength and stiffness along that axis, making it suitable for applications requiring durability. Conversely, biaxial stretching expands the film in both the length and width, leading to improved dimensional stability and flexibility. This versatility caters to a wider range of applications, including packaging and medical uses.</p></p>
